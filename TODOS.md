# To-Do's

- [ ] make corridors bend (at a corner) up to 2 times as needed (corridors can be straight, L shaped, or Z shaped)
- [ ] make corridor bend points (corners) happen at a random point
- [ ] always generate 9 rooms, and then randomly delete 0-3 rooms, replacing with corridors
- [ ] when placing corridors to a deleted room, pick a point somewhere randomly inside of where the room would have been to connect the corridors
- [ ] make some doors "secret" that appear as normal walls, requiring the player to search with the 's' key to reveal them
